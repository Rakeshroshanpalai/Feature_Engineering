    "#1) What is a parameter?\n",
    "#In machine learning, a parameter is a value that is learned from the training data and is used by the model to make predictions. For example, in linear regression, the slope and intercept of the line are parameters that are adjusted during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2) What is correlation?\n",
    "#Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another.\n",
    "# What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "#Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. For instance, in a dataset of temperature and heating bill, the correlation might be negative: as temperature goes up, the heating bill goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3) Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "#Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The main components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data: The foundation of any ML model.\n",
    "#Algorithms: Methods used for learning from data.\n",
    "#Model: The output of training an algorithm with data.\n",
    "#Evaluation Metrics: Tools to assess the model's performance.\n",
    "#Features: The input variables.\n",
    "#Labels: The output variables (in supervised learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "#4)How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "#The loss value quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual data. A lower loss value indicates better performance, suggesting that the model is making more accurate predictions. Monitoring loss during training helps in adjusting the model and detecting overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5)What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "#Continuous Variables: Variables that can take any value within a range (e.g., age, height, temperature).\n",
    "#Categorical Variables: Variables that represent discrete groups or categories (e.g., gender, color, country).\n",
    "\n",
    "#6)How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
    "#Categorical variables can be handled using:\n",
    "#One-Hot Encoding: Creates binary columns for each category.\n",
    "#Label Encoding: Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
    "#Target Encoding: Replaces categories with the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "#Binary Encoding: A combination of hashing and one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7)What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    "#Training a dataset means using a portion of the data to teach the model how to make predictions. Testing a dataset involves evaluating the trained model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8)What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "#sklearn.preprocessing is a module in the Scikit-learn library that provides functions for scaling, transforming, and encoding data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms. Examples include StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and OneHotEncoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9)What is a Test set?\n",
    "#A test set is a subset of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of a model after training. It helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10)How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "#You can use train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection to split data into training and testing sets. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "#How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",

    "\n",
    "#11)Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    "#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps understand the underlying structure and patterns in the data, detect outliers, identify correlations, and ensure data quality. It can guide decisions on feature engineering and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#12)What is correlation?\n",
    "#Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another.\n",

    "df.corr()\n",
    "\n",
    "#15)What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
    "#Causation means that one event directly causes another. Correlation shows that two variables move together, but it does not imply causation. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated due to warm weather, but eating ice cream does not cause drowning.\n",
